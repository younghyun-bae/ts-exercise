# TypeScript

## What is TS?

Let's install the TypeScript compiler to transpile it into JavaScript for the browser to read.

- Console log shortcut `log` + `tab`
- Verify it runs on the terminal with the command `node main.ts`
- HTML template `!` + `tab`
- Install the compiler with the command `tsc main.ts`

For simple TypeScript exercises:

- `npm install -g ts-node`
- with `ts-node main.ts`, you can eliminate the JavaScript file and immediately check the result.

To update the JavaScript file every time:

- Using watch mode with `tsc main.ts -w`, you can check it immediately.
